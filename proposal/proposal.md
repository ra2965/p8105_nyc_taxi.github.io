#### 3\. Motivation

Taxicab service has been around New York City for as early as the late
1890s and has since been a major player in the NYC transportation
system. In 2011, the ridesharing company Uber went alive in New York
City, and disrupted the taxicab business tremendously. Since the
emergence of Uber, taxi usage and profits have gone down, causing the
value of NYC taxi medallion to go down by more than 80%. In NYC, there
are more rideshare vehicles than taxi medallion vehicles. In addition,
with the increasing prevalence of smartphones, more people choose to
order and pay for their rides via ride-sharing apps.

In this project, we ask the question, NYC taxicabs, besides being part
of the NYC signature look, do we still need them around? Our goal is to
provide data-driven insights into the taxicab operation in NYC and
determine if and why NYC cabs should still be around for a while. How
many passengers have NYC taxies picked up over the past couple of years?
How much does weather affect the cab business? How might pick up/drop
off locations affect the tips given? Etc.

#### 4\. The intended final products

  - The statistical models that show the potential association between
    the weather/pick-up locations/temperature and frequency of taking
    Yellow Cab in NY, and the association between weather and tip
    percentage.

  - The visualization of the current facts and the trend of change of
    Yellow Cab in NY(in 2019?), including travel miles, fare, tips, time
    and frequent pick-up/drop-down locations.

#### 5\. The anticipated data sources

  - [NYC TLC Trip Record
    Data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)
  - [NYC
    RNOAA](https://data.nodc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.ncdc:C00861)

#### 6\. The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

  - The dataset is large in size and contains huge numbers of records
    which can potentially make the data processing difficult and slow;
    we might need to decide on how to take a reasonable sample from the
    records.
