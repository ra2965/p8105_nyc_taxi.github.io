### 1\. Raw Data Explanation

  - **NYC Weather Data:** The weather of New York City (NYC) in 2018 raw
    data is from the [Global Historical Climatology Network’s daily data
    (GHCND)](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/global-historical-climatology-network-ghcn).
    This dataset can be downloaded by `rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors`.

  - **NYC Yellow Taxi Data:** The NYC yellow taxi raw data is from the
    [TLC TriP Record
    Data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page).
    It contains all the yellow taxi trip records in NYC from 2009 to
    2019. First, to analyze change of the NYC yellow taxi use across 10
    years, we focus on Yellow Taxi Trip Records raw data in every month
    of 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017. Next, to analyze change of the NYC
    yellow taxi use in detail, we focus on the yeat of 2018 and generate
    randomly sampled sub-datasets for each month in 2018. Because the
    raw data is too large, we put it in a folder named *raw\_data* and
    added it to the `.gitignore` file. So the *raw\_data* folder was not
    uploaded to the Github. The monthly sub-datasets were generated by
    randomly sampling 100,000 observations from each month of 2018 and
    saved in the folder *data*.

### 2\. Datasets Generation and Cleaning

Because the raw data is too large (over 100GB), all the code chunks
below are set as `eval = FALSE` after we generate sub-datasets that we
need so that this Rmd file can be knitted.

##### 2.1 NYC Weather Dataset

The code chunk below generates the NYC weather dataset `weather_df`
containing daily temperature and precipitation in NYC 2018 and saves the
dataset as ***weather\_nyc\_2018.csv*** in the folder ***data***.

``` r
weather_df = 
  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(
    c("USW00094728"),
    var = c("PRCP", "TMIN", "TMAX"), 
    date_min = "2018-01-01",
    date_max = "2018-12-31") %>%
  mutate(
    name = recode(id, USW00094728 = "CentralPark_NY"),
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10) %>%
  select(name, id, everything())

write.csv(weather_df, "./data/weather_nyc_2018.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

##### 2.2 Monthly NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Datasets in 2018

The code chunk below generates the 12 NYC yellow taxi datasets with
100,000 observations randomly sampled from the yellow taxi records in
each month of 2018, and saves the datasets
***yellow\_tripdata\_2018\_month*** in the folder ***data***. These
datasets are used for detailed analysis of the NYC yellow taxi use
within a year. The code chunk below also generates a file having daily
total number of taxi orders named as
***2018\_taxi\_trip\_daily\_summary*** in the folder ***data***.

``` r
set.seed(1)

file_name = list.files(path = "raw_data", pattern = "2018")

taxi_trip_2018_df = map(.x = file_name, ~ read_csv(str_c("raw_data/", .x)))

taxi_trip_2018_df_sampled = 
  taxi_trip_2018_df %>% 
  map(.x = ., ~janitor::clean_names(.x)) %>% 
  map(.x = ., ~sample_n(.x, 100000)) %>% 
  map(.x = ., ~arrange(.x, tpep_pickup_datetime))

map2(.x = taxi_trip_2018_df_sampled, .y = file_name, ~write.csv(.x, str_c("./data/", .y)), row.names = FALSE)  

taxi_trip_2018_df_summary = 
  taxi_trip_2018_df %>%
  map(.x = ., ~mutate(.x, date = as.Date(.x$tpep_pickup_datetime))) %>%
  map(.x = ., ~select(.x, date)) %>%
  map(.x = ., ~count(.x, vars = date)) %>% 
  bind_rows()

taxi_trip_2018_df_summary = filter(taxi_trip_2018_df_summary, n > 10000)
    
write.csv(taxi_trip_2018_df_summary, "./data/yearly_summary/2018_taxi_trip_daily_summary.csv")
```

##### 2.3 Yearly NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Datasets between 2009 and 2017.

The code chunk below generates yearly NYC yellow taxi datasets (rides,
passengers, fares etc.) from the yellow taxi records in 2009, 2011,
2013, 2015, 2017, and saves the datasets in the folder ***data***. These
datasets are used for general analysis of the NYC yellow taxi use in the
past 10 years.Because the data is over 100GB and our computer can’t
handle it all at once, we generate datasets year by year instead
importing all of them once.

``` r
file_name = list.files(path = "raw_data", pattern = "2017")

taxi_trip_2017_df = map(.x = file_name, ~ read_csv(str_c("raw_data/", .x)))

taxi_trip_2017_df_summary = 
  taxi_trip_2017_df %>% 
  map(.x = ., 
      ~summarise(.x, total_ride = nrow(.), total_passenger = sum(passenger_count), total_fare = sum(total_amount), mean_fare = mean(total_amount), median_fare = median(total_amount))
  ) %>% 
  bind_rows() %>% 
  mutate(
    file = file_name
  ) %>% 
  select(file, everything())

write.csv(taxi_trip_2017_df_summary, "./data/yearly_summary/2017_taxi_trip_summary.csv")
```
