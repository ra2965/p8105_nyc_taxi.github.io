### 1. Raw Data Explanation

-   \*\*NYC Weather <Data:**> The weather of New York City (NYC) in 2018 raw data is from the [Global Historical Climatology Network's daily data (GHCND)](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/global-historical-climatology-network-ghcn). This dataset can be downloaded by `rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors`.

-   \*\*NYC Yellow Taxi <Data:**> The NYC yellow taxi raw data is from the [TLC TriP Record Data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page). It contains all the yellow taxi trip records in NYC from 2009 to 2019. First, to analyze change of the NYC yellow taxi use across 10 years, we focus on Yellow Taxi Trip Records raw data in every January of 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019. Next, to analyze change of the NYC yellow taxi use in detail, we focus on the yeat of 2018 and generate randomly sampled sub-datasets for each month in 2018. Because the raw data is too large, we put it in a folder named *raw\_data* and added it to the `.gitignore` file. So the *raw\_data* folder was not uploaded to the Github. The monthly sub-datasets were generated by randomly sampling 100,000 observations from each month of 2018 and saved in the folder *data*.

### 2. Datasets Generation and Cleaning

##### 2.1 NYC Weather Dataset

The code chunk below generates the NYC weather dataset `weather_df` containing daily temperature and precipitation in NYC 2018 and saves the dataset as ***weather\_nyc\_2018.csv*** in the folder ***data***.

``` r
weather_df = 
  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(
    c("USW00094728"),
    var = c("PRCP", "TMIN", "TMAX"), 
    date_min = "2018-01-01",
    date_max = "2018-12-31") %>%
  mutate(
    name = recode(id, USW00094728 = "CentralPark_NY"),
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10) %>%
  select(name, id, everything())

write.csv(weather_df, "./data/weather_nyc_2018.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

##### 2.2 Monthly NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Datasets in 2018

The code chunk below generates the 12 NYC yellow taxi datasets with 100,000 observations randomly sampled from the yellow taxi records in each month of 2018, and saves the datasets ***yellow\_tripdata\_2018\_month*** in the folder ***data***. These datasets are used for detailed analysis of the NYC yellow taxi use within a year.

``` r
set.seed(1)

file_name = list.files(path = "raw_data", pattern = "2018")

taxi_trip_2018_df = map(.x = file_name, ~ read_csv(str_c("raw_data/", .x)))

taxi_trip_2018_df_sampled = 
  taxi_trip_2018_df %>% 
  map(.x = ., ~janitor::clean_names(.x)) %>% 
  map(.x = ., ~sample_n(.x, 100000)) %>% 
  map(.x = ., ~arrange(.x, tpep_pickup_datetime))

map2(.x = taxi_trip_2018_df_sampled, .y = file_name, ~write.csv(.x, str_c("./data/", .y)), row.names = FALSE)  
```

##### 2.3 Yearly NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Datasets between 2009 and 2019.

The code chunk below generates the yearly NYC yellow taxi dataset from the yellow taxi records in Januaries of 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, and saves the datasets in the folder ***data***. These datasets are used for general analysis of the NYC yellow taxi use in the past 10 years.
